Personally implemented solutions for exams and exercises for the 'Computing Systems' (Sistemi di calcolo) course at the Faculty of Computer and Automation Engineering at Sapienza University.
This course predominantly focuses on the meticulous translation of programs from C into Assembly utilizing AT&T syntax, specifically tailored for IA-32 architectures. Additionally, it emphasizes the implementation of POSIX-compliant programs that incorporate extensive utilization of the C Library. Moreover, for functions without wrappers, direct system call usage is implemented, demonstrating a blend of high-level programming and assembly language skills, coupled with practical kernel interaction through accurate system call utilization.
